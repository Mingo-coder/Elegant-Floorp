# Elegant-Floorp 
for Windows
CSS from different sources to make Floorp Browser elegant enough to be a daily driver.
This is a simple css designed for Floorp.
I need to document all the other changes I made in about:flags eventually.
The theme I used is Floorp Fluential UI in Settings>Design> with compact toolbar
I set the homepage to web.tabliss.io rather than the tabliss extension.

The codes were modified from https://github.com/datguypiko/Firefox-Mod-Blur
I made this for personal use but turned out quite useful so I hope it's ok with the original author of the theme.
